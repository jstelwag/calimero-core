		Base package of the Calimero library. All functionality part of Calimero 
		is located in sub packages (besides here).<br>
		This package only contains a few classes and methods used throughout the library, 
		as well as the <code>Settings</code> class used to query library 
		related information, mainly of interest for a user of the library 
		and/or developer. 
		<p>
		This package contains common types of (checked) exceptions 
		thrown throughout the library by <code>public</code> or 
		<code>protected</code> visible methods.
		<br>
		In general, checked exceptions used in Calimero should extend the base exception 
		<code>KNXException</code>.
		<p>
		<b>Unchecked exceptions only:</b><br>
		Since a method might throw any type of runtime exception, even those not 
		specified here, there is no Calimero specific base exception for this.<br>
		Nevertheless, internal error states and failures originating from Calimero itself
		should be signaled through Calimero specific exceptions if possible.
